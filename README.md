# UPRAISE
 Is concept on which investors can invest in business owners seeking for funding. In exchange for their money, the Investors typically requires a stake in the business, which is a percentage of ownership and a share of the profits. In return for giving up a stake in the company, the entrepreneur gets funding, but often, more importantly, they get access to the Investor , their network of contacts, their suppliers, and their experience. (Determining the amount to invest in the company and the percentage of ownership that each is willing to consider comes down to forecasting revenue, earnings, and applying a valuation to the company. Rather than just providing the investment platform like a common startup incubator we aim to provide mentorship to the young generation startup founders along with the Networking  Opportunity which will surely help the user. We also aim to provide business/marketing strategies that may help in revenue growth.
